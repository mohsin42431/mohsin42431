Stack Implementation in C#

Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure using a singly linked list in C#. It includes basic stack operations such as Push, Pop, Peek, checking if the stack is empty, and displaying the stack elements.

Features

1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.


2. Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.


3. Peek: Returns the top element without removing it.


4. IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.


5. Display: Prints all elements of the stack.
